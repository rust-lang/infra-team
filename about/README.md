## Stakeholders

The stakeholders of the infrastructure team are:

- _Rust developers_: They use the infrastructure to download releases and crates
  and visit the Rust websites.
- _rust-lang/rust contributors_:
  - They use the rustc CI to test their changes.
  - They use bors to merge their changes.
- _Rust project_: They rely on the Rust infrastructure (such as bots) to
  improve Rust.
- ..and more

## Values

We prioritize wellbeing over everything else and we want to avoid burnout at
all costs.

## Team structure

The infrastructure team members are either:

- Full-time employees of the Rust Foundation, who are paid to work full-time
  on the infrastructure team.
- Volunteers who contribute to the infrastructure team in their free time.

There might be shades of gray between these two categories, like people
paid to work part-time on the infrastructure team.

## Goals

The Rust infrastructure should be:

- _Reliable_: The infrastructure should be accessible when needed and should
  work as expected.
- _Secure_: It should be secure to interact with the infrastructure.
- _Fast_: We want to optimize our infrastructure so that it's as fast as
  possible, to optimize the developer experience.
- _Financially responsible_: Even though parts of the infrastructure are
  sponsored, we want to optimize
  our infrastructure so that we ask the least amount of money possible.
- _Easy to maintain_: Maintaining our infrastructure should be as easy as
  possible. E.g.:
  - we want to automate as much as possible the maintenance of
    the infrastructure, so that maintainers can focus on more important things.
  - we want to refactor our code so that it's easier to read and edit.
- _Easy to contribute to_: We want external contributors to be able to
  contribute to the infrastructure easily.

We have the following goals for the infrastructure team:

- _Sustainability_: We want to make sure that the infrastructure team is
  sustainable in the long term. Members of the infrastructure team should have
  a good time while working here.
- _Growth_: We want to grow the infrastructure team, so that we can dedicate
  more time to the team's responsibilities.
  We want the Rust community to be aware of what we are working on, so that
  interested people can contribute to tasks they are interested in.
  If we manage to offer them a good experience
  (e.g. they work on something they enjoy, with high impact, while learning new
  things)
  they might decide to join the team and we'll have more capacity to work on
  more things.
