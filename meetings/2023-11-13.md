## Topics

- Do we want to move these notes to [rust-lang/infra-team](https://github.com/rust-lang/infra-team)
  after the meeting?
  - Yes.
- Any topics for the call with GitHub later today?
  - Jakub: Any updates on caching Docker layers?
    - We will ask, but probably no news.
    - We should implement a proper fix anyways, not rely on the hack that is in
      place right now.
    - See [#t-infra > CI caches](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/242791-t-infra/topic/CI.20caches)
