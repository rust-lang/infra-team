## Topics

### Conferences

- Marco and JD are going to RustConf
- Marco, JD, Pietro, and Jakub are going to EuroRust

### Council and Project Director Elections

- Our council representative is up for election soon
- Project Director elections are coming up as well

### CI

- It would be great to start testing the parallel frontend without blocking CI
  on it
- Probably better to run it in another repository and not `rust-lang/rust`
- Might need access to one or more large runners
  - [ ] Jakub will create the repository
  - T-infra will provision a large runner for the repository
- T-infra cannot really maintain this, but the wg-parallel-rustc should be able
  to do it themselves

### Start-release

- Terraform produces a diff, is the latest version commited?
- [ ] Marco will check the source code locally vs. on Lambda and report back

### Sync-team

- Different configurations in Terraform and Terragrunt
- Terragrunt configuration seems unused
  - Was set up for the out-of-band confirmations
- [ ] Marco will destroy the infrastructure in Terragrunt and decommission the
      account
- [ ] JD will create a tracking issue on GitHub

### Discord-mods-bot

- Can probably be deleted as well
- [ ] Marco will reach out to mods and check with them
