# Service Catalog

The service catalog lists the infrastructure, services, and apps that the
maintains. It is a work-in-progress and not exhaustive. It is our intention to
improve it as we go.

The documentation in the service catalog is inspired by the [Diataxis]
framework, which proposes a systematic approach to categorize into tutorials,
how-to guides, explanations, and reference documentation.
