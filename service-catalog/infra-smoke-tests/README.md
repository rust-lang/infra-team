# Infra smoke tests

The [infra-smoke-tests] repository contains a set of tests that are run against
the infrastructure to ensure that it is working as expected.

Use cases:

- Check if there's an ongoing incident.
- Ensure that modification to the infrastructure (e.g. `terraform apply`)
  worked as expected.
