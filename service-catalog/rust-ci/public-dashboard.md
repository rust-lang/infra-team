# Public dashboard

Datadog can only be accessed by certain Rust teams.
However certain data are useful to everyone, so the infra team created a
[public dashboard](https://p.datadoghq.com/sb/3a172e20-e9e1-11ed-80e3-da7ad0900002-b5f7bb7e08b664a06b08527da85f7e30)
to monitor the Rust CI.

This dashboard is just a clone of the Datadog CI
[dashboard](https://docs.datadoghq.com/continuous_integration/?site=us).

This dashboard is also documented in the
[rustc-dev-guide](https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/tests/ci.html#public-ci-dashboard).
